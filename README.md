# Circle Crop Tool

A simple graphical application for cropping images into circular shapes using Python. This tool allows users to load an image, draw a circle over it, and save the cropped image in the desired circular shape. The application is built using `tkinter` for the graphical user interface and `Pillow` (PIL) for image processing.
